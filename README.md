Project Details:
  
Habitat for Humanity needs a computer system to improve the utilization of the items in the warehouse. The system
shall support the following features at a minimum.
<ul>
<li> When items are received at the warehouse, their descriptions, quantity, and storage location within the
warehouse will be entered into the inventory records, along with the date.
<li> When items are removed from the warehouse, the inventory records will be marked to indicate this fact, along
with the date. The system will maintain a history of items.
<li> When planning a project, a project leader can use the system to reserve materials that are currently in the
warehouse. The system shall prevent conflicting reservations.
<li> The system shall generate inventory reports for project leaders and the organization’s management.
</ul>
Your team is responsible for implementing the hypothetical database
application. This project addresses only a subset of a real
system's requirements.
The database system will be implemented in any DBMS and conventional
programming language of your choice.
<br>
<br>
Purpose: The purpose of the project is to provide students the opportunity to combine
previous knowledge and skills with the knowledge and skills learned in this
course and apply them to a real-world application. 
Habitat for Humanity is a charitable organization that builds homes for poor families. Materials are donated by
businesses and individuals in the community; and labor is contributed by volunteers. Habitat for Humanity is staffed
by volunteers who have a wide range of technical skill levels.
Habitat for Humanity has a warehouse for storage of building materials and home furnishings that will be used in their
projects. Currently, there are no written records of what is in the warehouse. When planning a project, a project
leader walks around the warehouse looking for useful items. These items are either gathered together in one place
or tagged for later pickup.
